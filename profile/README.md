We set the following goals for SAV Open Playground (SAVOP):
- A development and simulation platform for new SAV technologies
- An experimentation environment for network operators to test their configuration
- A web application that helps networking professionals understand different SAV mechanism
- An education platform for students to learn about SAV

We have three public projects:
1. SAV reference router.
2. SAV agent.
3. SAVOP virtual network manager.
